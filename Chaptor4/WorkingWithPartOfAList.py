#Slicing A LIst

players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[0:3])

#If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your slice at the beginning of the list:

players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[:4])

players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[2:])

players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[-3:])

#Looping Through a Slice
#Instead of looping through the entire list of players at âžŠ, Python loops through only the first three names:

players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print("Here are the first three players on my team:")
for player in players[:3]:
    print(player.title())

#Copying a List

my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]

print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)

print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)

# This doesn't work:

friend_foods = my_foods
my_foods.append('cannoli')
friend_foods.append('ice cream')
print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
